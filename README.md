# Ticketmaster Take Home Challenge
## The Challenge:
### This project has been completed as part of [Ticketmaster's](https://www.ticketmaster.co.uk/) application process for an Apprentice Software Developer. The objective was to identify various user stories, raise an issue per user story and work through one of them. Applicants have been asked to focus on the front end aspects of their chosen user story.

## My [user story](https://github.com/AsmahanM/Ticketmaster-Challenge/issues/4) of choice:
### I have chosen to focus on building the form that user's will fill in once they have clicked the waiting list button. I focused on the following elements:
- [x] Have a clear heading indicating its purpose and a call(s) to action.
- [x] Allow the user to input their mobile number.
- [x] The mobile input box should only accept numbers and the '+' character. 
- [x] Allow the user to input their email address. 
- [x] The email placeholder input should be editable and the input box should not be visible (as per the design reference).
- [x] Provide checkboxes to allow users to select how they would like to be contacted.
- [x] Have a confirmation button to allow the user to submit their input.

## Styling
### In order to maintain Ticketmaster's brand identity, I made sure to incorporate their [brand colours](https://design.ticketmaster.com/brand/color/). I used variable codes in the CSS to maintain uniformity.
### I used the design of the form that was provided as a reference and attempted to recreate it as much as possible. 

## Challenges
### I couldn't find access to Ticketmaster's [brand typeface](https://design.ticketmaster.com/brand/typography/), Averta, online so I found one that was similar and added letter and word spacing to achieve a similar look. 
### Secondly, as I'd increased the size of the checkboxes, this also increased the size of their borders and I couldn't find a way to manipulate their width/boldness.

## Potential design inprovements
### Ticketmaster has a great colour pallette and I really like the shades of blue that contribute to the brand's identity. The current form is very clean- I think incorporating a little more colour could be a fun way to make use of the brand's colours. This could be done by adding some gradient to the buttons.
